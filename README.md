# iohook
Node.js global native keyboard and mouse listener.  
This module can handle keyboard and mouse events via native hooks.  
**(this module don't require Java (jnativehook) or any other runtimes. Raw C++ implementation, should be very fast)**  


## OS Support
Already tested in:
- Ubuntu 16.04 / 17
- macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 and older
- Windows x32/x64

## Installation
This module use native library libuiohook and require some installed packages.  
I really hope find way for use build systems for online build or download prebuild packages.

`npm install iohook --save`  
_PS: TypeScript types already included_

### Electron users [optional]
Before install this module, you need specify build runtime.
Just add following to your package.json file
(if you use two-package-json structure, add to app's package.json, not to build).  
Checkout your ABI for [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/) or [electron](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-abi)
```json
"iohook": {
  "targets": [
    "node-51",
    "electron-53"
  ],
  "platforms": [
    "win32",
    "darwin",
    "linux"
  ],
  "arches": [
    "x64",
    "ia32"
  ]
}
```
**NOTE: Please remember, when you install iohook, it try to use current node environment NOT ELECTRON OR NW.js**

### Prebuild support  
iohook support prebuilded binaries for next environment versions:  
- electron:
  - [47] 1.0.2
  - [48] 1.2.8
  - [49] 1.3.13
  - [50] 1.4.15
  - [51] 1.5.0
  - [53] 1.6.0
  - [54] 1.7.0

- node:
  - [46] 4.6.1
  - [47] 5.12.0
  - [48] 6.9.4
  - [51] 7.4.0
  - [57] 8.9.3
  - [59] 9.2.0

Support for node.js v0.12, io.js, nw.js is planed.

## Manual compilation for your version of environment  
iohook have prebuild binaries, it downloads when you try to install it.  
But if you use specified version of node.js/nw.js/io.js/electron/etc. you can try compile it.  
All what you need install os dependencies and start compilation:

### Ubuntu 16
- `sudo apt install libx11-dev libxtst-dev libxt-dev libx11-xcb-dev`
- `sudo apt install libxkbcommon-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev`
- `cd node_modules/iohook`
- `npm run build`

### macOS
- `brew install cmake automake libtool pkg-config`
- `cd node_modules/iohook`
- `npm run build`

### Windows  
Install: msys2 with autotools, pkg-config, libtool, gcc, clang, glib, C++ Build Tools, cmake  
- `cd node_modules/iohook`
- `npm run build`

## Usage
Module is pretty simple for use. There is example:  

```javascript
'use strict';
const ioHook = require('iohook');

ioHook.on("mousemove", event => {
  console.log(event);
  /* You get object like this
    {
      type: 'mousemove',
      x: 700,
      y: 400
    }
   */
});

//Register and start hook
ioHook.start();
```
If type ```ioHook.start(true);``` you can enable debug logger in native lib. Use it if you have troubles with this module

### Shortcuts support
You can register global shortcuts.  
**NOTE: When shortcut called, keyup/keydown events still emit events. It mean if you register keyup and shortcut for ALT+t both events will be emited**

 `registerShortcut(keys, callback):number`  
In next example we register CTRL+F7 shortcut (in MacOS, for other OS, keycodes can be some different)  
```js
let id = ioHook.registerShortcut([29, 65], (keys) => {
  console.log('Shortcut called with keys:', keys)
});
```
  
`ioHook.unregisterShortcut(shortcutId)`  
You can unregister shortcut by using shortcutId returned by `registerShortcut()`   
```js
ioHook.unregisterShortcut(id);
```

`ioHook.unregisterAllShortcuts()`  
Also you can unregister all shortcuts   
```js
ioHook.unregisterAllShortcuts();
```

### Available events

### keypress (NOT WORKING AT THIS MOMENT, USE keydown/keyup)
Calls when user press and release a key. Event contain next object:  
`{keychar: 'f', keycode: 19, rawcode: 15, type: 'keypress'}`

### keydown
Calls when user press a key. Event contain next object:  
`{ keychar: 'd', keycode: 46, rawcode: 8, type: 'keydown' }`

### keyup
Calls when user release a key. Event contain next object:  
`{keychar: 'f', keycode: 19, rawcode: 15, type: 'keyup'}`

### mouseclick
Calls when user click mouse button. Event contain next object:  
`{ button: 1, clicks: 1, x: 545, y: 696, type: 'mouseclick' }`

### mousedown
Calls when user press and release a key. Event contain next object:  
`{ button: 1, clicks: 1, x: 545, y: 696, type: 'mousedown' }`

### mouseup
Calls when user press and release a key. Event contain next object:  
`{ button: 1, clicks: 1, x: 545, y: 696, type: 'mouseup' }`

### mousemove
Calls when user press and release a key. Event contain next object:  
`{ button: 0, clicks: 0, x: 521, y: 737, type: 'mousemove' }`

### mousedrag
Calls when user press and release a key. Event contain next object:  
`{ button: 0, clicks: 0, x: 373, y: 683, type: 'mousedrag' }`

### mousewheel
Calls when user press and release a key. Event contain next object:  
`{ amount: 3, clicks: 1, direction: 3, rotation: 1, type: 'mousewheel', x: 466, y: 683 }`

## Known issues
In some cases, most often when you make mouse moves or keyboard events very fast,
module crash with "Segmentation fault: 11". Looks like it is problem in my native implementation,
but I still can't find a problem. Will be happy if somebody helps with it.
